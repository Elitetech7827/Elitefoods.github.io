              You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive ("Charges"). Olili Food will receive and/or enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or goods obtained through your use of the Services. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, restaurants charges and/or surcharges including a booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments.
              <br />
              All Charges and payments will be enabled by Olili Food using the preferred payment method designated in your Account or Olili.ng platform, after which you will receive a receipt by email or text. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Olili Food may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Olili Food and all refunds are made to your Olili.ng system wallet.
              <br />
              As between you and Olili Food, Olili Food reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Olili Food's sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Olili Food will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Olili Food may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a Third Party Provider’s behalf. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback. Olili Food may use the proceeds of any Charges for any purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other third parties.
              <br />
              In certain cases, with respect to Third Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third Party Providers, and Olili Food will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third Party Provider’s behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third Party Provider. Olili Food will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate a Third Party Provider, if applicable, for the services or goods obtained in connection with your use of the Services. In all other cases, Charges you incur will be owed and paid directly to Olili Food or its affiliates, where Olili Food is solely liable for any obligations to Third Party Providers. In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from Olili Food for services or goods received by you from a Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Olili Food will respond accordingly to any request from you to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. Olili Food does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to a Third Party Provider. Any representation by Olili Food (on Olili Food's website, in the Application, or in Olili Food's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Olili Food provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to a Third Party Provider you may use. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.
